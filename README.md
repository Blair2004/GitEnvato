# GitEnvato
This is a NexoPOS module with one single aim: Ensuring your GitHub releases were published on Envato (CodeCanyon/ThemeForest). 
As a developer, I often publish updates of my item that is also on Envato, but I always find myself going through the boring steps of uploading and publishing.
I spent 2 days doing some reverse engineering to make it possible. 

# Documentation
The whole project is [documented here](https://my.nexopos.com/en/marketplace/item/gitenvato-update-your-envato-items-from-github)
